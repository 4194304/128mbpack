<b>The 128MB pack is a pack that makes Minecraft run on just 128MB of memory while keeping things simple.</b>
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the pack</li>
<li>Launch it</li>
<li> Wait until you reach the title screen then close it</li>
<b>If it crashes, make sure that you have at least 512mb of memory allocated to the game and try again.</b>
<li>Set the amount of memory down to 128mb (on Prism/MultiMC it's in the instance settings)</li>
<li>You should be able to launch it with 128mb of memory.</li>
</ol>
<b>If you can't launch it with 128mb memory after the necessary steps are completed, try step 4 again.</b>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The 128MB pack keeps it simple but has a few useful features too.</p>
<p>Such features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>No Chat Reports</b></li>
<p>To disable chat reporting and save some memory.</p>
<li><b>No Telemetry</b></li>
<p>To reduce crashes and stop Microsoft from collecting data about you.</p>
<li><b>Options Profiles</b></li>
<p>A simple button in the top left corner of the pause and options screen that lets you choose different profiles. Within this modpack there are three profiles for various use cases.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Profiles</h3>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4194304/miscrepo/main/profiles.gif" alt="There are three profiles, fast, medium and fancy." style="width:600px;height:338px;">
<b><u><p>These are the three profiles:</p></u></b>
<ul>
<b><li>Fast</li></b>
<p>The most memory saving and least intensive setting, the fast profile is great for singleplayer and intensive areas in multiplayer servers (lobbies, especially Hypixel.)</p>
<b><li>Medium</li></b>
<p>More a middle ground between fast and fancy if you want to save some memory while having decent graphics. The medium profile is good for multiplayer servers where crashing could occur.</p>
<b><li>Fancy</li></b>
<p>The most intensive out of all of the presets. Has an 8 chunk render distance and all of the vanilla settings. On servers where crashing could occur, use the medium or fast presets. The fancy preset is very crash prone so it can only be used in certain places like SMPs or vanilla worlds.</p>
</ul>
<h2>Singleplayer</h2>
<p>At the current time, singleplayer works but is extremely unstable. It can only be used with the fast preset, normal worlds don't work without save editing, and loading chunks too fast can crash the game.</p>
<h2>1.20.2</h2>
<p>In 1.20.1 a pack like this would've been extremely unstable, but 1.20.2 is a lot stabler than 1.20.1 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nvFzr_KvsE?si=sAbQBM-fX8WRWBqD" target="blank">I even made a video on what the 128mb pack in 1.20.1 was be like</a>). In some testing that I did, the vanilla game can run on just 209mb of memory. Because of 1.20.2, singleplayer and the fancy settings work. With 1.20.1 and below I might do that in the future but it's currently not planned.</p>
